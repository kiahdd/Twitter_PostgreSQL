# Twitter_PostgreSQL
How I built a Twitter dashboard, From building an ETL pipeline to automatically update a dashboard.

Goal:

This project aims to build an automatic ETL pipeline that allows me easily to update the dashboard every Monday. For this reason, I choose to store the data in the Postgresql database, which I can store every weekâ€™s new data and load to Tableau. Besides, I want to write a script that I can reuse for different hashtags and keywords.
